# Stedi Converter Example Project

This project provides a small example on how to use the Stedi Converter SDK. The SDK is available in
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stedi/sdk-converter-node), and there's an example on how to use it in `/src`
. `/tst` provides a test file to convert.

* Disclaimer: the API and SDK are still classed as Developer Preview, and under active development - therefore subject
  to change.

## Install

```shell
npm ci
